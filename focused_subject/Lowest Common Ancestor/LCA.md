## Summary

- The LCA problems have relatively fixed solving ideas. Once you are familiar with the ideas of solving it, it would be pretty easy.

- Basically there is two ways(ideas) of solving LCA.
  - Recursion.
    - example: 236, 1676
  - get paths of two nodes to root(as two arrays for example), and get the lowest common node.
    - example: 1650, 2096
