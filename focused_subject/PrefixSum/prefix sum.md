## Summary

Usually we try to solve a problem with `Prefix Sum` when the question ask something like "Sum of subarray". The logic here is that we could easily get any subarray's sum by calculating `Prefix Sum` in advance. It is only a one-pass O(n) time complexity.

Examples above are some of the classic questions using prefix sum.

The complete solution often combined the Prefix Sum with Hash Table. (Not necessary)
