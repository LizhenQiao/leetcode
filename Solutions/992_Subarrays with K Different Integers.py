Keys:
- Point for this question is that we should notice at once that subarraysWithAtMostKDistinct is a typical sliding window unit
  question which is easy to solve. Then we would realize that we could convert `subarraysWithKDistinct(k)` to
  `subarraysWithAtMostKDistinct(k) - subarraysWithAtMostKDistinct(k-1)`.
- Actually, this sub-question is almost the same with "Leetcode340.Â Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters",
  except that we are counting all possible #subarray instead of the longest one. Thus we use `result += right - left + 1`
  instead of `maxl = max(maxl, right - left + 1)`. But eventaully, thinking of them in a sliding window format, we would
  notice that they are the same problem. But this one is definitely more abstract.
